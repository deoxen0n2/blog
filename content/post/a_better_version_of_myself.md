*"Be the better version of yourself"* &mdash; you probably have heard this advice many times already. But I'm not here to talk about it or to talk about philosophy around it.

I've literally seen a person, that is like myself, but damn he's so much better, like at least 10x or 20x better.

The good news is I'm always looking for someone who also is like me but also a lot stronger, to look upon, to improve myself, and to know that my limit is not just here.
