These are my favorite apps. By app I mean application on Desktop, iOS, or Android that is small and efficient enough to just do (mostly) one thing and do it well.

## Remember The Milk

I tried both Todoist and Wunderlist before, nothing really sticks to me like Remember The Milk. RTM is so simple, efficient, and cute that I want to use it every day. It's the first time I like this kind of app and use it more than 3 days.

## Dropbox

Well, I use it mainly because it integrates well with Linux and can also use on my iPad Mini 4 and Nexus 5X. Quite handy.

## Paper By 53

Paper By 53 is good for drawing and relaxing. It can also be used for work but on professional level Lucidchart is usually more appropriate.

## Spotify

Say no more.

What your favorite apps? Feel free to leave in the comments. Thank you :)
