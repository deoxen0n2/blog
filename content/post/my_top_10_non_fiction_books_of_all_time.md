Hope someone finds this useful. The list is in order, with brief review on each book :)

# 10. What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20

![What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20](/img/book_what_i_wish_20.jpg)

Written by Tina Seelig, a Stanford professor. Tell her stories on the experience she has, it is a collection of lessons she learnt, and how we can learn from her, too.

But what I like the most of this book is this kind of notion:

> "Allow yourself to try"

That's the main idea. **No one forces you into thinking anything, not trying or trying anything, for what it's worth, allow yourself to try.**

# 9. David and Goliath

Tell the many different stories of how did underdogs beat up the favorites that happen so many times throughout our history. **How advantage becomes disadvantage.**


# 8. Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less
![Essentialism Cover](/img/book_essentialism.jpg)

**"Less is more"**, you heard it many times, didn't you? But this book explains it in understandable terms and explores it with short real life stories. If I could rate this book higher on this list I would. This is the book I read almost everytime I think I don't know where to go.

# 7. Talent is Never Enough

![Talent is Never Enough Cover](/img/book_talent_is_never_enough.jpg)

This book is actually the book that got me into reading. It explains why talent is not the only thing that can make people success in their life. It explains what other things that may help you in your life.  It explains **why talent is never enough**.

# 6. Rework

![Rework](/img/book_rework.jpg)

I like this book not because one of the authors is DHH, the Ruby on Rails creator, but because this book is so charming in its own right. **Tell you to look closely how you work currently, how can you work differently, and why should you**.

# 5. 5 Dysfunctions of a Team

![5 Dysfunctions of a Team](/img/book_5_dysfunctions_team.jpg)

Well, many books got me into management disciplinary, but this book certainly hit the nail. It tells the stories related to 5 dysfunctions that could happen to any team (and usually happen to) and how to fix them.

It may surprise you that the 5 dysfunctions is just a basic ones every one may alrady know. But did you really look into them closely enough? Did you know how to fix them, efficiently? This book will help you in this.

I would rate this book one of the greatest management books of all time.

# 4. Thinking, Fast & Slow

![Thinking, Fast & Slow](/img/book_thinking_fast_slow.jpg)

Actually this book is only the one book in this list that I didn't finish despite reading it for nearly 5 years. It is exiting enough that I don't want to miss any detail.

Basically this book describes how your brain work. How it has two systems working in a different way, fast and slow. And how they affect our thinking, rationalale, and emotion.


# 3. As a Man Thinketh

![As a Man Thinketh](/img/book_as_a_man_thinketh.jpg)

**"As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he?"** is the quote from the book (actually it's from the Bible) that should succintly describes what this book is all about. I think I will never describe it better but I will try it anyway:

> "You are the result of your thinking."

It's a small book though (like, really small, just 64 pages), I assure you it's worth reading.

# 2. Outliers

![Outliers](/img/book_outliers.jpg)

Ever wonder why someone is always standing out of the bunch? How can he/she/they do that (think Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, The Beatles, etc.)? What do they do differently to the rest of us?

American tought us to believe in ourselves, to make our own way upto the top or whatever place we want to go, but is that really the whole story? Did they do everything themselves to go to where they are now? Or there is more to that?

This book challenges those ideas and demystifies how and what we can do for society to make every one a better life.

# 1. 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens

![7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens](/img/book_7_habits_teens.jpg)

This books sit, sleep, whatever in my bed like forever. Whenever I feel alone, whenever I'm not so sure about my life or what's going on, this book helps me correct things and focus on my way, on my life. It tells you 7 habits that could help you win in your life. I read this book more than 50 times if I can count I think, but still I'm not a master on this. I'm still trying though :)

And that's it! I'm curious to what the list you have, if you please share it with me I would be grateful. Happy Songkran Day :)
