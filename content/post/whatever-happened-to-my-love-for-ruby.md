The year is 2012, the year I met the Ruby programming language. The year I met the best programming language of my life.

It was really both difficult and enjoyable time of my life. Ruby was and is still a really hard to get into and to master language. But I made it, through lots of lots of books, blog posts, videos (thank you, Mr. Bernhardt), and the most awesome community.

That time is the time I will remember forever.

But after I graduated in 2015, I never have had a chance to touch it again. What happended was I getting into Node.js because of the tools I used back there, and then Go, which is also kind of a good time, too, but it's just never like the time with Ruby.

And now I've grown out of them, I don't feel attached to any programming language anymore. What matters to me now is not the language. I feel like I have better things to do. And that's what I will do, and care.
