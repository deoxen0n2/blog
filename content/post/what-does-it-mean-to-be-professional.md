Well? Let's find out.

In my opinion, these are things that I think every professional must has:

* Stay organized
* Know what to do
* If don't know what to do, ask, consult, think, organize
* Do what's right

It is hard to do what's right if you don't know how to do it. Like should I rest? should I work? should I A rather than B?

I think there is no correct answer. It is most likely to come with experience.
