Sadly and shamefully, me in my 25 year I still don't know what it is. Let's find out.

In my opinion, these are things that I think every professional must has:

* Stay organized
* Know what to do
* If don't know what to do, ask
* Show up when needed (it is actually needed every time, though)

Or in summary:

> Do what's right.

But it is hard to do what's right if you don't know how to do it. Like should I rest? should I work? should I do A rather than B?

I think there is no correct answer. It is most likely to come up with experience and also through mentorship, which I think I luckily have. What it is needed for me now, maybe, is trying to learn more and try to improve myself on this.
