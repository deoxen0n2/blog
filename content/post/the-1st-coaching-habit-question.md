The Kickstart Question:

> **What's on your mind?**

If you don't start with this or don't know how to start, then 1 of these 3 situations might kicks in:

1. The Small Talk Tango - Rarely the bridge that leads to a conversion that matters
2. The Ossified Agenda - Process in front of what really matters
3. The Default Diagnosis - You may both think you know what the issue is, but digging the wrong hole isn't going to help

So *"What's on your mind?"* is more open, but focused, and encouraged. Then you can use the **3Ps** model to continue afterward: focus on **Project**, **People**, or **Patterns** that might be at the heart of the issue.

> Asking the Kickstart Question works as a little pressure-release valve and helps makes explicit something that might be unduly influencing the way you work.
