Hmm, of course it's all Ruby!

JK.

Here my day-to-day tools and why I use them.

## Main Programing Language

Go. I can write Go. Others can read it. Others can improve it. Go is so simple it hurts.

## Scripting Language

NodeJS. Modules are as various as Ruby's or Python's. Very easy to install on most systems ([nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)). NPM is bundled or you can also install Yarn very easy.

Asynchronous tasks are often better expressed in NodeJS rather than other languages. Mainly because I get used to it anyway.

Secondary choice is Python. It is supported by most systems.

And of course Bash. The main point of having StackOverflow is for Bash obviously.

## Productivity

I considered using Terminal and Vim and my brain as already using productivity tools. Occasionally I also use tmux and [tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator).

That explains why my work is so slow.

## GUI

Normally it is React and Redux with Ant Design components. Very easy to use and be productive with. And also with Electron (and maybe Foreman if I need multiple background processes) I can easily distribute it for others.

## Virtual Machines

VBox and Docker (not a virtual machine per se, but whatever) obviously. Isolation is nice since I tend to do multiple things within 1 week.

That's it I think. Until next time!
