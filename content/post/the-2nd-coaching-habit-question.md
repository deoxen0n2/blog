The AWE Question:

> **And what else?**

This question forces you and the others to consider more choices, and probably better choices. The first choice is rarely the best choice. And also this question will stop you to turn into advice-giver/expert/answer-it/solve-it/fix-it mode before knowing the situation.

However, don't go too far, you may encounter *The Paradox of Choice.*

> *"And what else?"* works so well because it keeps people generating options and kees you shut up.

And, remember, stay genuinely curious.
